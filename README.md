# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
# What did you do particularly well?
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

For this project, I took on the role of a staff member at a small consulting firm specializing in software and hardware solutions for various clients. The project
lead brought in DriverPass, a program designed to enhance students' readiness for driving exams through behind-the-wheel instruction and online practice tests
simulating real-world driving conditions. The system needed to ensure that the training materials and rules were up-to-date with local DMV regulations. Key features
included push alerts, compatibility with various operating systems, and a scheduling system for managing time with driving instructors on both desktop and mobile
devices. While I believe I performed well overall, I recognize that I could improve my familiarity with all user needs and better incorporate them into the system
design. I could have also improved on being more cleaner with my diagrams or find a different program to better design my diagrams I created so it is not as chaotic
in my opinion and being a critic of my diagram(s) work.
